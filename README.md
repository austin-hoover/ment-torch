# MENT-Torch

Experimental PyTorch implementation of MENT (maximum entropy tomography). Builds on NumPy version here: https://github.com/austin-hoover/ment.

With a differentiable particle tracking model, one can explore sampling methods that use the gradient of the distribution function, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. If this proves useful, development may switch to this repo.
